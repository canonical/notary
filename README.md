## Getting Started

Install the snap:
```bash
sudo snap install notary
```

Generate (or copy) a certificate and private key to the following location:
```bash
sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /var/snap/notary/common/key.pem -x509 -days 1 -out /var/snap/notary/common/cert.pem -subj "/CN=example.com"
```

Start the service:
```bash
sudo snap start notary.notaryd
```

Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` to access the Notary UI.

## Reference

### Configuration

Notary takes a YAML config file as input. The config file can be passed to Notary using the `-config` flag.

The config file requires the following parameters:
| Key                  | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| key_path             | string            | path to the private key for enabling HTTPS connections                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| cert_path            | string            | path to a PEM formatted certificate for enabling HTTPS connections                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| db_path              | string            | path to a sqlite database file. If the file does not exist Notary will attempt to create it.                                                                                                                                                        |
| port                 | integer (0-65535) | port number on which Notary will listen for all incoming API and frontend connections.                                                                                                                                                              |
| pebble_notifications | boolean           | Allow Notary to send pebble notices on certificate events (create, update, delete). Pebble needs to be running on the same system as Notary. Read more about Pebble Notices [here](https://github.com/canonical/pebble?tab=readme-ov-file#notices). |

An example config file may look like:

```yaml
key_path:  "/etc/notary/config/key.pem"
cert_path: "/etc/notary/config/cert.pem"
db_path: "/var/lib/notary/database/certs.db"
port: 3000
pebble_notifications: true
```

You can generate the cert and the associated key by running:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 1 -out cert.pem -subj "/CN=example.com"
```

Notary does not support insecure http connections.
