# Notary

Notary is an open-source TLS Certificate Management software. It provides a secure, reliable, and simple way to manage x.509 certificates for your applications and services.

We designed Notary for Enterprise environments where users need to securely manage the lifecycle of a large number of certificates. 

## Key features

- **Certificate Authority**: Notary can act as a Certificate Authority (CA) to issue certificates, both as a root and intermediate CA.
- **Secure Intermediary**: Notary acts as an intermediary between your CA and your certificate requests, providing a secure way to distribute certificates.
- **User Management**: Decide who can request and provide certificates.
- **Simple UI**: A simple and intuitive web interface for managing certificates.
- **Extensive HTTP API**: Accomplish all the tasks you can do in the UI via the HTTP API.
- **Metrics**: Monitor the state of your certificates and the health of your Notary instance with Prometheus metrics.
